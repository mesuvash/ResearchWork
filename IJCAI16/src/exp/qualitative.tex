In this section, we provide a qualitative evaluation of the item-item similarities learned by our I-\LinearLow model. 
We use \Fotolia, a dataset from a major stock image market site\footnote{\scriptsize The dataset sharing agreement with the provider restricts us from reporting the statistics and quantitative results. Hence, we do not report summary statistics and quantitative results on this dataset}.  
The data provides whether a given user has clicked on a particular image category, and from these our model can infer the similarity measure between
the image categories. Note that the similarity is inferred solely based on the click patterns, without doing any analysis of the textual content of
the category names.
We choose this dataset for the qualitative evaluation mainly because the items are category names and are much easier to interpret
compared to the other datasets.





% users clicks on various image categories. 
% Since the similarity metric is an important aspect of personalization, we evaluate the item-item similarities learned by I-\LinearLow  model on the \Fotolia dataset. 

In Table~\ref{tbl:similarity-evaluation}, we show some examples of top-5 similar items learned by I-\LinearLow model. We observe that the model 
discovers very meaningful and explainable similarities, hence making it very applicable in similar item recommendations.
