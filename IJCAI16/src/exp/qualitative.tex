In this section, we qualitatively analyze the item-item similarities learned by I-\LinearLow model. We use \Fotolia dataset\footnote{\scriptsize The dataset sharing agreement with the provider restricts us from reporting the statistics and quantitative results. Hence, we do not report summary statistics and quantitative results on this dataset} to assess the  similarites learned by the model. This dataset consists of user interactions i.e. clicks on various image categories.
% users clicks on various image categories. 
We choose this dataset mainly because the items are easier to interpret compared to other datasets.
% Since the similarity metric is an important aspect of personalization, we evaluate the item-item similarities learned by I-\LinearLow  model on the \Fotolia dataset. 

In Table~\ref{tbl:similarity-evaluation}, we show few examples of top-5 similar items learned by I-\LinearLow model. We observe that  the model learns meaningful and explainable similarities, hence making it very applicable in similar item recommendations.
