In this paper, we proposed a fast low dimensional regularized linear model, \LinearLow, to addresses the computational bottleneck of linear model, enabling it to scale up to large OC-CF problem while retaining essentially the same performance. In our comprehensive experimentation, we illustrated that the proposed method is computationally superior to the state-of-the-art, more specifically 10 folds faster, and yields competitive performance. Future work may explore user and item side-information as well as further improving the computational and memory footprints by exploring more efficient dimensionality reduction techniques.
