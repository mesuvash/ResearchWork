In this paper, we defined a novel fast low dimensional regularized linear model, $\LinearLow$, for one-class collaborative filtering. The proposed method exploits fast randomized SVD algorithm for dimensionality reduction followed by an analytical solution to the low dimensional multi-regression problem for scalability. In our comprehensive experimentation, we illustrated that the proposed method is computationally superior to the state-of-the-art, more specifically 10 folds faster, and yields competitive performance. Future work may explore user and item side-information as well as further improving the computational and memory footprints by exploring more efficient dimensionality reduction techniques.
